# PyOrigin Examples
A demonstration of how I perform some of the most common tasks using PyOrigin. This readme file generated automatically by running all of the tests in [examples.py](examples.py), saving its output as [output.txt](output.txt), and generating this markdown-formatted summary page thanks to [convert.py](convert.py)

## Starting Conditions
```python
import PyOrigin # always
import numpy as np # if used
```

## Output
If you run all these tests, the output will look something like this:
